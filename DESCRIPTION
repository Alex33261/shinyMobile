Description: Develop outsanding 'shiny' apps for iOS, android, desktop as well as beautiful 'shiny' gadgets.
    'shinyMobile' is built on top of the latest 'Framework7' template <https://framework7.io>.
    Discover 14 new inputs widgets (sliders, vertical sliders, stepper, 
    grouped action buttons, toggles, picker, smart select, ...)
    with unique design for iOS, android, desktop. 'shinyMobile' supports 2 themes, light and dark. 
    12 new widgets (expandable cards, badges, chips, timelines, gauges, progress bars, ...) 
    combined to the power of server side notifications, alerts, modals, toasts,
    action sheets, sheets and more will help you to deliver full featured apps.
    There are currently 3 layouts: the single layout for simple apps, the tabs layout for
    more complex apps and the split layout, the latter specific to tablets or desktop.
    Finally, 'shinyMobile' handles progressive web apps: configure the manifest
    so that your app may be launched directly from your phone apps instead of 'Safari'
    or 'Chrome' (see <https://rinterface.github.io/shinyMobile/reference/create_manifest.html>).
